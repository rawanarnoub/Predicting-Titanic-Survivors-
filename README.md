Project: Predicting Titanic Survivors

üß† Project Goal:
Build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, sex, ticket class, and more.

üì¶ Dataset:
Titanic Dataset on Kaggle: no wo
Contains two files:

train.csv: With labels (Survived: 0 = No, 1 = Yes)

test.csv: Without labels (used for final prediction submission)

üìä Input Features Include:
Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)

Sex: Gender

Age: Age in years

SibSp: # of siblings/spouses aboard

Parch: # of parents/children aboard

Fare: Passenger fare

Embarked: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

Cabin, Ticket, Name (can be engineered)

‚úÖ Target Variable:
Survived: 0 or 1

üõ†Ô∏è Project Steps:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understand data distributions and class imbalance

Visualize survival rate across different features (e.g., male vs. female, age groups, ticket class)

Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values (e.g., fill age using median or predictive imputation)

Encode categorical features (e.g., one-hot or label encoding for Sex, Embarked)

Feature engineering (e.g., extract title from Name, bin Age into groups)

Model Building

Try models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost

Use cross-validation for model robustness

Evaluation

Use accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

Bonus (Advanced):

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV



üìå Learning Outcomes:
Apply supervised classification techniques

Practice data wrangling and feature engineering

Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics

Understand how data bias (e.g., gender, class) can affect predictions
